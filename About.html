<p class=about>
Founded in 2021, as a response to the recent abortion ban in Texas, our group advocates for the right to legal and safe abortions for all women across America. 
The Texas Heartbeat Act is a reminder of the ongoing battle that millions of women face across the nation. This is so much more than just another debate about politics or religion. This is about supporting bodily autonomy and protecting our human rights. Attacks against legal abortions didn’t end after Roe v. Wade* and will never end until we fight for the change we want to see in our government. We want to see pro-choice candidates elected. We want to help women understand their rights and judge how policies affect their freedom, body, and future. We want to uplift voices that promote women’s health and access to abortions. We want women to hold their heads high and say, “It’s my choice and no one else’s.”

*Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction.
