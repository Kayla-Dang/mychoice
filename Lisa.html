I had unprotected sex once and was in no position to raise a child. I went to an abortion doctor in a place where abortion was illegal. I wondered if I would die of septicemia in a back room. If something had gone wrong I knew there would be no hospital that I would be sent to. It was a terrifying experience. My next two abortions were soon after WITH birth control that I used faithfully. I just had bad luck. I remember walking through the pro-life hate picketers. I wanted them to know that I did not want to do that to my body but I could not responsibly bring up a child. Their lack of compassion still astounds me. We must keep this legal. I am one in three.
